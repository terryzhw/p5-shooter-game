A shooter game made with Javascript using p5.js. There are waves of enemies that move around randomly while the player has to dodge 3 shots that randomly fire from the side. The player can move with WASD, shoot with space, and use a shield abilty to block against boss shots. After all enemies are killed, a boss will spawn which will move randomly while firing shots at the player. If the player manages to kill the boss, they win. If not, they lose. Health packs will randomly spawn around the map which can heal the player for a certain amount.
